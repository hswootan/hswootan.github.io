[{"description":"FriendZone is an easy difficulty Linux box which needs fair amount enumeration. By doing a zone transfer vhosts are discovered. There are open shares on samba which provides credentials for an admin panel. From there, an LFI is found which is leveraged to get RCE. A cron is found running which uses a writable module, making it vulnerable to hijacking.","id":0,"section":"posts","tags":["Hackthebox","OSCP","php","web","network","vulnerability assessment","protocols","source code analysis","authentication","smb","dns","web site structure discovery","password reuse","scheduled job abuse","local file inclusion","remote code execution","anonymous/guest access","path hijacking","sensitive data exposure","zone transfer"],"title":"Hackthebox - Friendzone","uri":"https://hswootan.github.io/en/posts/friendzone/"},{"description":"Irked is a pretty simple and straight-forward box which requires basic enumeration skills. It shows the need to scan all ports on machines and to investigate any out of the place binaries found while enumerating a system.","id":1,"section":"posts","tags":["Hackthebox","OSCP","vulnerability assessment","stenography","outdated software","security tools","reversing","metasploit","backdoor","binary exploitation","suid exploitation","maintain access","clear text credentials","information disclosure"],"title":"Hackthebox - Irked","uri":"https://hswootan.github.io/en/posts/irked/"},{"description":"TartarSauce is a fairly challenging box that highlights the importance of a broad remote enumeration instead of focusing on obvious but potentially less fruitful attack vectors. It features a quite realistic privilege escalation requiring abuses of the tar command. Attention to detail when reviewing tool output is beneficial when attempting this machine.","id":2,"section":"posts","tags":["Hackthebox","OSCP","c","php","apache","web","vulnerability assessment","common applications","outdated software","wordpress","tar","web site structure discovery","remote file inclusion","remote code execution","misconfiguration"],"title":"Hackthebox - Tartarsauce","uri":"https://hswootan.github.io/en/posts/tartarsauce/"},{"description":"Sunday is a fairly simple machine, however it uses fairly old software and can be a bit unpredictable at times. It mainly focuses on exploiting the Finger service as well as the use of weak credentials.","id":3,"section":"posts","tags":["Hackthebox","OSCP","finger","web","network","protocols","authentication","ssh","reconnaissance","user enumeration","password cracking","brute force attack","sudo exploitation","weak credentials","misconfiguration"],"title":"Hackthebox - Sunday","uri":"https://hswootan.github.io/en/posts/sunday/"},{"description":"Poison is a fairly easy machine which focuses mainly on log poisoning and port forwarding/tunneling. The machine is running FreeBSD which presents a few challenges for novice users as many common binaries from other distros are not available","id":4,"section":"posts","tags":["Hackthebox","OSCP","apache","vnc","web","network","vulnerability assessment","injection","authentication","tunneling","password reuse","port forwarding","local file inclusion","clear text credentials","weak authentication","log poisoning"],"title":"Hackthebox - Poison","uri":"https://hswootan.github.io/en/posts/poison/"},{"description":"Valentine is a very unique medium difficulty machine which focuses on the Heartbleed vulnerability, which had devastating impact on systems across the globe.","id":5,"section":"posts","tags":["Hackthebox","OSCP","ssl","web","vulnerability assessment","session handling","outdated software","web site structure discovery","weak permissions"],"title":"Hackthebox - Valentine","uri":"https://hswootan.github.io/en/posts/valentine/"},{"description":"Node focuses mainly on newer software and poor configurations. The machine starts out seemingly easy, but gets progressively harder as more access is gained. In-depth enumeration is required at several steps to be able to progress further into the machine.","id":6,"section":"posts","tags":["Hackthebox","OSCP","linux","javascript","python","web","vulnerability assessment","security tools","reversing","authentication","nodejs","hydra","binary exploitation","password cracking","suid exploitation","buffer overflow","clear text credentials"],"title":"Hackthebox - Node","uri":"https://hswootan.github.io/en/posts/node/"},{"description":"SolidState is a medium difficulty machine that requires chaining of multiple attack vectors in order to get a privileged shell. As a note, in some cases the exploit may fail to trigger more than once and a machine reset is required.","id":7,"section":"posts","tags":["OSCP","linux","apache james","pop","web","vulnerability assessment","outdated software","python","default credentials","weak permissions"],"title":"Hackthebox - Solidstate","uri":"https://hswootan.github.io/en/posts/solidstate/"},{"description":"Sense, while not requiring many steps to complete, can be challenging for some as the proof of concept exploit that is publicly available is very unreliable.
